# ToDoList
A Todo List App with Electron, React and NeDB

To run the application, be sure to install all its dependencies first ("npm install") and understand that the app will use the port "8080" to run the Rest API (NeDB).

This was made for an academical purpose, aiming to study a different kind of DB (other than Relational). Seeing the opportunity to study another tech that I found interesting, I decided to try Electron.js .
The front was made in React merely because it is the tool I have more experience with, which would take less time on the project (besides I had a template already).
